The scene of much alcohol consumption, vomiting, games of <A HREF="http://www.maths.nott.ac.uk/personal/odl/riskfaq.html">Risk</A>, and, <FONT SIZE=-2>just occasionally</FONT>, some last-minute overnight cramming.</P>

<!-- Hannah / Penguin -->
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:hannah@cpenguin.com" NAME=penguin>Hannah</A>
<P>A delightfully geeky maths / compsci grad whom I met in cyberspace via our mutual friend <A HREF="#simon">Simon</A>.  Had the dubious honour of being my first email-blind-date last Autumn when she accompanied me to our company Christmas bash.</P>

<!-- Jammy -->
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:jammytea@aol.com" NAME=jammy>Jammy Tea</A>
<P>The original daytripper, with impeccable music taste.  I met Jampot at Nottingham, where he influenced my CD collection for the better.  A friend indeed.</P>

<!-- Mark -->
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

<!-- Simon -->
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:simonm@retail-logic.co.uk" NAME=simon>Simon</A>
<P>Without a doubt, one of the greatest human beings it has been my privilege to meet.  I bumped into Simon on a school bus in 1987, and after a chat about the latest developments in the world of Lego, we quickly became firm friends.</P>

<!-- Smarticus -->
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:martin_a_smith@hotmail.com" NAME=smarticus>Martin</A>
<P>I have never met Martin, nor have I ever fully grasped what it is he <I>does</I>.  However, he seems to travel the world, sending me amusing emails, so that's OK.  Proprietor of the <A HREF="http://www.smarticus.force9.co.uk/" TITLE="Martin's Homepages" TARGET="_blank">House of Scoob</A>.</P>
