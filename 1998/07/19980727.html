<P>Back at work, back to "real life", back to getting up at 5:45am and commuting to the office.  I desperately need to get a place closer to work.  A slight backlog of work from days I was off - emails asking me to test stuff, phone calls asking me if live runs went OK, etc.  Mondays suck.  But fortunately, it's going to be a short week...</P>
