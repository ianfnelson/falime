<P CLASS=first>My sister has just been visited by two cops - seems my 14-month old niece just dialled 999 when nobody was looking.  Ooopsy!  My sister is creasing up laughing, but I'll just take this opportunity to apologise to the taxpayer on behalf of my Goddaughter...!</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>Saturday, then.  First job - organise all the junk that has accumulated on my floor over the past week.  Second job - organise all the junk that has accumulated on my hard drive over the past week.  And boy, is there a lot of junk.  I went on a bit of a download frenzy last night, whilst my internet connection was reasonably speedy.  I got the full version of <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/" TARGET="_blank">Netscape Communicator 4.5</A>, upgraded my copy of <A HREF="http://www.real.com/" TARGET="_blank">RealAudio</A>, and downloaded a cute lil' utility called InterMute, which claims to block all those irritating banner ads, animated gifs, etc, making your browsing experience faster and more enjoyable.  Haven't had a chance to test drive it yet, but it got a fairly decent review in one of the magazines this month.</P>

<P CLASS=first><B>19:06</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday night TV is just <I>so</I> pathetic it's quite depressing.  <I>Gladiators, Noel's House Party, Casualty, You've Been Framed, Family Fortunes, The Generation Game, London's Burning</I>...  dull, boring, predictable programming.  I'm glad I don't rely on the TV for my entertainment - anyway, I have other things to get finished, so it's probably just as well there's nothing on the box to distract me.  Besides, I have The Pixies' Greatest Hits in my hi-fi :)</P>
<P>Reading online journals is <I>so</I> much more entertaining and interesting.  There are many great new diaries appearing at the moment - I'll try to add to my <A HREF="../../links/diaries.html" TARGET="dayview">links page</A> soon.</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>The notebook/laptop idea continues to niggle away at the back of my mind.  I've been adding up prices, checking out specs, reading the reviews, etc.  I figure if <A HREF="../../cast/cast.html#richard" TARGET="dayview">Richard</A> is gonna buy a new car to celebrate passing his exams, then I should get a notebook to celebrate... uh... um... Halloween.  Or something.  Maybe.</P>
<P>It has practical application in addition to simply being another weapon in my geeky arsenal - I'll be able to keep this journal updated more regularly when I'm away from home, keep up with my email, etc.  But mostly I just <I>want</I> a new electronic toy.  Sad, isn't it?</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>The wintry weather has truly begun to set in now.  I know we didn't exactly have a summer this year, as such, but at least we had a bit of a respite from the kind of rain that has been lashing the nation over the past few days.  The clocks go back an hour tonight, also.  I guess this means the shopping mall will rapidly start filling up over the next few days, as people begin to desert the city centre shops.  I'd better get everybody's Christmas presents figured out ASAP - can't stand to be shopping in crowds.  Wonder if I could mail-order everything over the net this year?</P>
