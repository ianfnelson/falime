<P>Well, thanks for the emails.  A few choice phrases thus far:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>"flip a coin!"</P>
<BR><P>"If they want you now they'll still want you in a year's time."</P>
<BR><P>"Portsmouth is f***ing miles away."</P>
<BR><P>"There is a fine balance between earning loads and getting no job 
satisfaction and doing something that you enjoy and getting loads of 
satisfaction."</P>
<BR><P>"£2k a year is a lot to lose for someone in your financial situation.  No offence, Ian."</P>
<BR><P>"Do you really like Scotland that much??"</P>
<BR><P>"Money is just too tempting, isn't it?"</P>
<BR><P>"Do you really want to live in the South?"</P>
<BR><P>"Can they guarantee interesting work?"</P>
<BR><P>"Can they guarantee <I>work</I>?"</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I'm rapidly approaching the decision which has been somewhat pre-determined for a while now.  I think I'm going to decline the kind offer.  Reasons?  Well, I'd be lying if I overlooked the potential drop in salary, but I'm also taking into account the prospects.  I believe I can make a good living out of IT for the forseeable future.  Public sector work is a bit more of an unknown quantity.  Plus, I enjoy the flexible working conditions I have at the moment, I don't want to become a nine to five suit.</P>
<P>So, there we go.  Maybe I'm turning down the greatest opportunity of a lifetime.  Life's too short.  I wish I had the time to try out dozens of careers, but I don't, so I have to go with the information and the feelings I have, and do what I think will suit me best.  Maybe after reincarnation I'll try the Scientist thing - hell, what am I on about?  I'm only 22, I could still take a change of career post-Y2K.  For now, I'm staying put and riding out the seemingly inevitable recession.</P>
<BR>
<P>In other news...</P><BR>
<P>Yeah, the colours up on that calendar are a bit gaudy.  I have poor sense of colour, I'm a mathematician!  I'll mess about with them later, OK?</P>
<BR><P>*sigh*, my Mother wants me to go help a colleague out with his company PC.  He has no idea how to work it, and daren't ask the support dept any more.  I wish she wouldn't offer my services to people I don't even know.  I told her to warn him I'll charge £15 an hour.  She laughed.  Maybe I'll be nice, and charitable, and help out - the postmodern equivalent of helping an old lady across the road, you might say.  Or maybe I'll just ignore the problem and hope he <FONT COLOR="gray"><I>(a)</I></FONT> asks somebody else <FONT COLOR="gray"><I>(b)</I></FONT> discovers the wonders of online help.</P>
