<P CLASS=first>I note with interest and incredulity that Geri Halliwell, former Spice Girl, has been appointed "Goodwill Ambassador" to the United Nations!  Just two short years since the <A HREF="../../cast/cast.html#grovey" TARGET="dayview">Grovey Roaders</A> voted her the 'second most shaggable Spice Girl', the ex-Ginger Spice is now 'campaigning for women in developing countries to enjoy the same rights to health care and access to contraception as those in the industrialised world.'</P>
<P>Fair enough.  I'm sure that'll make a far greater contribution to the planet than any number of 'Zig-a-zig-ah's ever did.  Still seems weird though.</P>
