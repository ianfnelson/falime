<P>I know, I should be typing up details of my exploits in the Highlands over the past week, but for now there's something more pressing on my mind.  It seems that I didn't perform as badly at the job interview on 15 September as I thought - I've been recommended for the post.</P>
<P>I don't know whether to accept or decline.  There's no gut feeling, just a big jumble of mixed up "what if?" type thoughts.  Maybe that means I should decline, if I'm not thrilled about the prospects?  Ah, but then I don't exactly love what I do at the moment, do I?  You should know, dear reader, I've bitched about my boredom enough in past journal entries.</P>

<P>Ah, maybe I'll use work tomorrow as some sort of litmus test.  But for now, I'm wary of grabbing this opportunity and running with it, so perhaps it isn't the right thing for me.</P>
