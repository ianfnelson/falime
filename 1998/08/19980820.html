<P>Two great spontaneous phone calls on the same day.  Don't you love it when that happens?  Joanna phoned me on the mobile, to see "how things are going up there".  She didn't realise I'd taken Friday off work, and so was back at home, not at work.  So I called back on a landline, and we had a good chat.</P>
<P>And a short while later, Emma phoned me.  It's been a while since we've chatted, so it was good to hear from her, especially after spending all week away from home chatting to people whose interests and opinions don't really match mine.  We talked long about careers and life, which way to head, that kind of thing.  We're both pretty bored doing what we do.  Then we also talked about silly things, like the acceptance by Oxford and Cambridge of split infinitives.  It's such a nice feeling talking to an old friend again and finding that they're just the same deep down as they always were, especially when our day-to-day lives seem mixed-up or dull.  It's like a breath of fresh air.</P>
