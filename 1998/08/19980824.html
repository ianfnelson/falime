<P>All I really wanted to do was drive home and have a shower, but Jammy's nan is kindly attempting to feed me my body weight in carbohydrate, and I'm too polite to refuse.  Then she asks me questions which, in their own right, are perfectly sensible, but they don't seem to apply to me, and I struggle to express my opinions on the economic crises in Japan and Russia because they are not my primary concern.  Old people are cool, they make you question your sanity and your mindset, and I like that.</P>
<P>My day-to-day life is back upon me once more, and I can't remember how it's meant to go.  So I phone a colleague and ask him to tell me what's on my schedule+ for the week ahead.  Then I feel in touch with my life once more.</P>
