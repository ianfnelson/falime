<P>I hate washing cars.  What the hell was I thinking of?  I should've just taken it to the nearest Shell Aqua-valet as usual, rather than foolishly attempt to achieve something of a physical nature.  Can anybody explain to me how you wash a car by hand without it ending up all streaky?  Morky now looks worse than he did when I started, to the extent that somebody else is now doing the job "properly", lest he lowers the tone of the cul-de-sac.  I'm sweaty and dirty and stinking of car shampoo, and for what?</P>
<P>Lisa I'Anson on the car radio - <I>"It's the hottest day of the year, it's caught most people out somewhat, so what are you doing to make the most of the sun?"</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Lisa, darling, I've retreated inside with a bottle of Evian and a Marvin Gaye CD, where I shall sit and code Java applets until sunset.  Ah, heaven!</P>
