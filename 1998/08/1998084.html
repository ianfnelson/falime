<P>It was announced today that the company I work for (medium-sized, British) is being
acquired by a large American company who are looking to expand outside North America.  
The general consensus among everybody seems to be that this is a good thing
(even the most cynical of my colleagues can't see a downside). So we're
all off to the NEC tomorrow for a presentation by both sets of management.
I've already done some web-based research, and I like the look of my new
paymasters (whose name we shall officially adopt on September 1st - exactly
one year since I started work here) - they seem to be outperforming the
S&amp;P 500 index, and the culture sounds similar to our current ethos.</P>


<P>I guess only time will tell if I am right to be so optimistic, but there
are no warning bells sounding at the moment. As far as I can see, the only
immediate changes might be a nice new mousemat (and I could do with one
of those after the Jack Daniel's incident), and the possibility of some
overseas travel. Quoth one of our sales guys earlier today: "Yeah, I think
this could open up some exciting possibilities for those of us who have
few strings here." So I'm positively giddy.</P>

<P>I got some more
journal feedback from friends and acquaintances today, which is sweet and
most welcome, given that these pages have only been online a few days:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>"<I>Just read some of your "fear &amp;
loathing in middle England" (cool title by the way) and was mightily impressed
and amused by the little anecdotes.</I></P>
<P><I>Way to go!</I></P>
<P><I>It's a bit out of date though - 29 July! Slacker!</I>"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>"<I>Ack! It's alive!!</I></P>
<P><I>Just popped in and took a glance at your journal...</I></P>
<P><I>So your journey to "somebody-ness" (in contrast to "nobody-ness")
has begun.</I></P>
<P><I>A star is born. . .</I>"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
