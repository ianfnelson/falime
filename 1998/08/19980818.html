<P>My PC at work died for a few hours today.  I wasn't the only one - a fair proportion of people had the same problem, so it must've been a network problem.  I couldn't do anything - couldn't run calculator, Word, Solitaire, get a mainframe session, send email, check my diary, etc.  I suddenly felt very very powerless, and realised that without a PC to bash away at, my job amounts to nothing.</P>
<P>So, I achieved nada today.  Not my fault, either.  Hey ho.  One more day closer to Y2K.</P>
