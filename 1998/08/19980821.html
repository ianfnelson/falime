<P>Sitting in a tent, in a field near Leeds, at around midnight.  Swigging on some Jack Daniel's.  Putting up the tents in the dark was <I>not</I> an easy task, but we've done it.</P>
<P>Tomorrow is the first day of the V98 weekend, and I'm quite looking forward to it.  Jammy, The Wuss and myself sit and chat about which bands we're looking forward to the most.  Then without warning, the game of "bollocks" begins somewhere in the campsite.  It's quite a simple game, the rules to which go a little something like this:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Somebody shouts "bollocks".
<LI>Somebody else shouts "bollocks".
<LI>Repeat step 2.
</OL>
<P>I guess we're not going to get much sleep...</P>
