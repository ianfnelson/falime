<P>A good week for internal email.  Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps me sane.  I know people see my typing long missives about Manic Street Preachers lyrics and complain that I should be working, but I figure it makes me happier and more productive.  Honestly.  Anyway, here's a snippet from a conversation between some friends which made me laugh out loud.  It doesn't seem so funny, in retrospect, but y'know how it is, you're sat coding some JCL or whatever, and it's so dull that the slightest thing makes you piss yourself...</P>

<P>Look, it made me laugh, anyway...</P>
