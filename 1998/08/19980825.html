<P>I ache all over.  But I try to get back into the work ethic.  I book another couple of holidays for later this month, and it's suggested to me that maybe it would be easier if I started booking the days that I <I>will</I> be working.  Ho, and indeed, ho.</P>
<P>After a long weekend with people I can empathise with and understand, it's a bit of a culture shock to be back here again, listening to views that seem strange and alien.  I used to think I was fairly broad-minded and had been exposed to people from all walks of life - after all, I'd been to university, right?  How wrong I was.  There are a lot of very different, and occasionally plain weird people out there.</P>
