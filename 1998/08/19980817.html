<P>Then suddenly, from out of nowhere... an unexpected letter.  Just as I'm growing used to this lifestyle, there appears the possibility of a door leading elsewhere.  So do I head towards it, tentatively?  Or do I remain steadfast in the place to which I've become accustomed?</P>
<P>Surely it can't hurt, just to wander over and have a look?  It'd be foolish not to, right?  I can always stay here if I don't like what I see.  But now I'm laying here in a colleagues' room (nicking his place while he's on holiday) and my mind is racing with the notion of what might be.  I'm only twenty-two, I've only been graduated for thirteen months, I have colossal debts from my student days - can I afford to risk the security that I now have for something which, although more fun, may not pay for my matt black yuppie toys?</P>
<P>But I'm getting ahead of myself, looking too far down the line.  Nothing may come of this.  So I sit back and listen to my walkman, to Baby Bird singing an acoustic session in my head.  Sometimes the most simplistic things are the most beautiful.</P>
