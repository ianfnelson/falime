<FONT FACE="Verdana, Univers, Arial, Sans-Serif, Helvetica"><P>Five hundred brief days to go, then.  I had intended to devise a wonderful series of five compilation tapes leading up to the millennium, focusing on age, life, history, all that sort of melancholic stuff.  And I got round to compiling quite a long list of suitable songs before I got bored of the idea.  Too much hassle.  But I renewed my acquaintance with lots of wonderful old songs, so it wasn't a total waste of time.

<P>I was thinking and chatting about Y2K some more today - it seems to be the conversation de rigueur at the moment - when I started to think, for the first time, of how silly we apocalyptic doom-laden programmers will appear if there are no problems with the rollover.  There I'll be, sat with my candles, camping stove, bottled water, dried food, <I>Protect And Survive</I> leaflets, blankets, etc, and nothing happens.  I would imagine that my family and friends, into whom I am constantly attempting to put the fear of God regarding the millennium bug, would begin to take the piss somewhat.   
</P>
<P>But then; rather suffer a bit of ribbing at the hands of my friends than go into this thing totally unprepared.  Sometimes I worry that the only people taking this seriously are the programmers...
