<P>I'll let you do the arithmetic.  I really must become less dependent, for my own good as well as the good of the environment.  Driving (along with the use of VDUs) is making my eyes tired.</P>
<P>Do you ever write strange things when you're a little drunk?  I woke up this morning to find, scribbled on the table next to me on Posthouse notepaper, the words "Who do you see when you look in the mirror?".  I had to rush over to a mirror to check that I was still who I thought I was.  I just about recognised myself, although with a hangover it was hard to tell.  I gave breakfast a miss.</P>
<P>Courses are often boring.  The one I was on today wasn't too bad.  We did presentation skills, which I'm crap at, so maybe that's why they sent me on the course.  I'm a techie geek, I know my stuff but I don't like having to actually explain it to anybody else - especially not verbally.  This is one of the many things I hate about industry, and one of the driving forces persuading me to go into pure research.</P>
