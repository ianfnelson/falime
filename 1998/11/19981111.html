<P CLASS=first>Apart from alcohol-induced, I haven't felt at all ill since a Fresher's 'flu when I started uni in 1994.  So indigestion/stomach-ache/food poisoning came as a bit of a surprise, and I immediately assumed it was something more serious.  After discounting cancer, my favoured diagnosis was that a colleague had laced my tea with arsenic.  I wouldn't put it past him...</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>Aside from the curious defects of my physical manifestation, my average evening holds about as much interest as, well, my average day.  Television is exceptionally dull, bar a couple of amusing Channel 4 comedies just before bed.  So it is that I return to my books - biographies of Paul Erdos and Richard Branson.  Hey ho.</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>A splattering of links, to fill the void until I think of something worthwhile to say:</P>

<P CLASS=first>A thought - have you noticed how many online journals (including many exceptionally good ones) tend to use verdana as their de facto typeface?  I could be cruel and suggest that this is because nobody can spell 'helvetica' any more, but I won't.  Perhaps I should change FALIME's font to something different next month...</P>

<BR><HR><BR><P CLASS=first STYLE="font-size: 8pt">I often spend days on end away from my PC.  It's hell.  It has the side-effect that I don't get to update this journal as often as I like.  So, rather than have you making fruitless repeat visits to these pages, I've set up a notify list.  Just click the lovely pink button over on the left.  Alternatively, for the hyper-paranoid, simply <A STYLE="font-size: 8pt" HREF="mailto:journal@horatio.force9.net">email me</A> and I'll do the rest.</P>
