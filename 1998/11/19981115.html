<P CLASS=first>Only a mild hangover, which was nice.  To quote Rich, we seemed to drink just the right amount of alcohol so that today could be spent relaxing, not recovering.  Besides, I had things to do, shirts to iron - not an easy task for an INTP geek such as myself.  I needed help.  Altavista wasn't much cop, pointing me only to <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Cavern/2000/fnb/apx1.html" target="_blank">this satirical guide</A>.  Thanks, fellers, but I'm serious here.  <A HREF="http://www.aj.com" target="_blank" title="Ask Jeeves!">Jeeves</A> came to my rescue once again, pointing me to <A HREF="http://www.learn2.com/04/0476/0476.html" target="_blank" title="How to iron a shirt">this excellent how-to site</A>.  I love the internet.</P>

<P CLASS=first>Felt unwell again this evening - Wednesday's abdominal pain returned, sending me surfing to the medical self-help pages of the web.  Within 10 minutes I had diagnosed myself as having everything from indigestion to cancer, via appendicitis and irritable bowel syndrome.  I guess perhaps I should register with a GP instead.  The last time I visited a doctor was in 1986 when, aged 10, I had an earache.</P>
<P>The current issue of FHM has an amusing "Are you an emotional cripple?" self-test.  One of the questions is "Do you resist visiting your GP for anything less than amputation, scared he might find something?".  I had to tick that one.  In fact, out of ten categories, I scored positively on eight of them.  This is probably not a good thing...</P>

<BR><HR><BR><P CLASS=first STYLE="font-size: 8pt">I often spend days on end away from my PC.  It's hell.  It has the side-effect that I don't get to update this journal as often as I like.  So, rather than have you making fruitless repeat visits to these pages, I've set up a notify list.  Just click the lovely pink button over on the left.  Alternatively, for the hyper-paranoid, simply <A STYLE="font-size: 8pt" HREF="mailto:journal@horatio.force9.net">email me</A> and I'll do the rest.</P>
