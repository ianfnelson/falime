<P CLASS=first>My workload is decreasing once more.  My contribution towards fixing the millennium bug is just about over, and I'm wondering what to move onto next.  Management tell me there are opportunities elsewhere, and would I like to spend a couple of months messing around with spreadsheets, possibly from the comfort of my own home?  It sounds like a pleasant change, and I agree that my name can be passed forward.  But I don't expect anything to come of it.  We're still negotiating for further work at my current client site, and I'd be amazed if numbers were to deplete until those discussions were concluded.</P>
<P>So, then.  Minesweeper and Solitaire it is.  Thank goodness for the occasional funny email from <A HREF="../../cast/cast.html#lexy" target=dayview>Lexy</A> et al.</P>

<BR><HR><BR><P CLASS=first STYLE="font-size: 8pt">I often spend days on end away from my PC.  It's hell.  It has the side-effect that I don't get to update this journal as often as I like.  So, rather than have you making fruitless repeat visits to these pages, I've set up a notify list.  Just click the lovely pink button over on the left.  Alternatively, for the hyper-paranoid, simply <A STYLE="font-size: 8pt" HREF="mailto:journal@horatio.force9.net">email me</A> and I'll do the rest.</P>
