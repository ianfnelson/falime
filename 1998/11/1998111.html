<P CLASS=first>The B&B we stayed in was great - the proprietors were really welcoming, given that we were a bunch of five lads out on a bit of an alcoholic weekend.  As requested, they woke us for breakfast at 8am, although I wasn't really feeling up to the full cooked breakfast that I had foolishly opted for.  Still, the porridge was gorgeous - an alternative hangover cure, perhaps?</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>I couldn't face any walking.  Indeed, only Brucey and Rich did so, climbing two munros from a start point which entailed me driving them along an icy, mountainous single-track road.  I think I scared them somewhat - my driving doesn't exactly instill confidence, even when I'm not hungover.</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>After dropping them off, Lexy, Andy and myself returned to Killin, bought some newspapers and retreated to a pub.  I realised that my clothes were not exactly clean, and I was dishevelled and unshaven.  As Lexy gingerly approached the bar, I couldn't help but think of the scene in <I>Withnail & I</I> when the pair are attempting, unsuccessfully, to buy lunch in Penrith.</P>
<P>"Do you sell tea?", Lex asked of the barman.</P>
<P>"TEA?  What are youse doin' coming into a pub asking for TEA?", came the reply.</P>
<P>"Uh, we had a bit of a heavy night last night..."</P>
<P>"Aye, I suppose I can get you some tea."</P>
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<P CLASS=first>There was an interesting article in the <I>Sunday Times</I> about the increasingly popularity of mathematics.  Apparently students are taking the subject at higher levels in increasingly larger numbers.  There was a photo of a nineteen year old Edinburgh student, Jennifer Myers, whom Lex though was 'quite fit'.  Indeed, he came up with a plan to write to her, suggesting they 'got together to help promote maths amongst the young people of Britain'.  Hmmm...</P>

<BR><HR><BR><P CLASS=first STYLE="font-size: 8pt">I often spend days on end away from my PC.  It's hell.  It has the side-effect that I don't get to update this journal as often as I like.  So, rather than have you making fruitless repeat visits to these pages, I've set up a notify list.  Just click the lovely pink button over on the left.  Alternatively, for the hyper-paranoid, simply <A STYLE="font-size: 8pt" HREF="mailto:journal@horatio.force9.net">email me</A> and I'll do the rest.</P>
