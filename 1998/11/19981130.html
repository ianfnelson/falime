<P CLASS=first>Perhaps I left it a little late, but I'm disappointed at the range of Advent calendars available this year.  After scouring the supermarket shelves in the vain hope of finding a 'Beatles' calendar, a 'Manic Street Preachers' calendar or even just a 'Dennis the Menace' calendar, I had to settle on letting the Teletubbies help me count down the 24 days until Christmas.</P>
<P>At 99p I suppose it would be churlish to complain, and maybe I'm getting prematurely nostalgic here, but Advent calendars ain't what they used to be.  My spanking new Teletubbies calendar has inch-square doors, behind which lie milk-chocolate treats.  Fifteen years ago my calendar was virtually two-dimensional, making it difficult to open the fiddly half-inch square doors, behind which lay only some meaningful imagery - certainly no Po or Tinky-Winky.  I think I liked it better that way.</P>
<P>Regardless, I still wish I wasn't stuck with a choice between just Teletubbies, Barbie, and Thomas the Tank Engine!</P>

<P CLASS=first>I see Netscape have been bought by AOL.  Well, well, well.  That's more than a little sad, but I guess it's better than Netscape disappearing altogether.  Still seems a strange alliance though, like the dinosaurs in coalition with the dolphins or something.  That's a poor metaphor, I know, but it's late and I'm tired...</P>
<P>Here endeth the third age of web design.</P>

<P CLASS=first>Apart from these thrilling events, little is happening that is worthy of note.  I've just been reading Richard Branson's autobiography, which is more interesting than I expected.  He comes across as being a fairly cool guy, if a little naive in his younger days.  When I read autobiographies (and, for that matter, online journals), I often find myself comparing the traits described by the author to my own personality, or at least forming an opinion as to whether I can empathize with what is being said.  Well, Branson's personality type sounds very different to my own, but his underlying ideals and beliefs are vaguely similar, making it a fascinating read.  Totally different from the Paul Erdos biography that I've almost finished.</P>

<BR><HR><BR><P CLASS=first STYLE="font-size: 8pt">I often spend days on end away from my PC.  It's hell.  It has the side-effect that I don't get to update this journal as often as I like.  So, rather than have you making fruitless repeat visits to these pages, I've set up a notify list.  Just click the lovely pink button over on the left.  Alternatively, for the hyper-paranoid, simply <A STYLE="font-size: 8pt" HREF="mailto:journal@horatio.force9.net">email me</A> and I'll do the rest.</P>
