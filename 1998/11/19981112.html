<P CLASS=first>It seemed too good to be true - 110 laps at a go-karting circuit for £25 per person.  Yet this was what a colleague claimed to have organised.  Incredibly, it was every bit as good as he'd said - we each participated in two 55 lap races, plus a 5-minute qualifying section.  By the end of the evening, my clothes stank of petrol fumes, my hands were covered in oil, and I just <I>knew</I> that I would be aching the next day.  Fantastic.  The only hassle is returning to your car, and the public highways after such an event - I found myself oversteering, and driving far too quickly as I later travelled a short distance back to the house.</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>After the karting, we all piled into the first pub we found, which happened to be a half-deserted place in a dodgy-looking area of West Yorkshire.  But this, too, turned out to be unexpectedly enjoyable.  A couple of locals engaged us in a series of pub games and challenges, mostly of a physical nature.  Sit on a bar stool, and pick up a lighter off the floor using only your mouth, that kind of thing.  I couldn't believe that they weren't being paid for their troubles, and had to double-check that I hadn't somehow evaded paying an entrance fee.</P>
<P>Later, one of the female locals started chatting to us, asking where we were from, and how come we'd gone into that pub.  I listed the hometowns of half a dozen or so of my colleagues, and explained what we did for a living, and where.  She lamented that her life seemed dull in comparison, being mostly spent between her home a few streets away, and this pub, where she worked and socialised.  &para;"I'm too qualified to work behind a bar," she told me.  Maybe at that point I reflected somewhat on the good fortune of my own life, although I see nothing glamorous or enjoyable about spending so much time on the congested British motorway network.</P>

<BR><HR><BR><P CLASS=first STYLE="font-size: 8pt">I often spend days on end away from my PC.  It's hell.  It has the side-effect that I don't get to update this journal as often as I like.  So, rather than have you making fruitless repeat visits to these pages, I've set up a notify list.  Just click the lovely pink button over on the left.  Alternatively, for the hyper-paranoid, simply <A STYLE="font-size: 8pt" HREF="mailto:journal@horatio.force9.net">email me</A> and I'll do the rest.</P>
