<P CLASS=first>A phone call from Richard, evidently in a bowling alley, judging by the noise in the background:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>"Hi Nel - who sang 'We Close Our Eyes'?"</P>
<P>"Um..."</P>
<P>"Was it Duran Duran?"</P>
<P>"No, it was Go West"</P>
<P>(Pause as Rich discusses this suggestion with his colleagues)</P>
<P>"Yeah, that's it, cheers!"</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Glad to be of service....</P>

<BR><HR><BR><P CLASS=first STYLE="font-size: 8pt">I often spend days on end away from my PC.  It's hell.  It has the side-effect that I don't get to update this journal as often as I like.  So, rather than have you making fruitless repeat visits to these pages, I've set up a notify list.  Just click the lovely pink button over on the left.  Alternatively, for the hyper-paranoid, simply <A STYLE="font-size: 8pt" HREF="mailto:journal@horatio.force9.net">email me</A> and I'll do the rest.</P>
