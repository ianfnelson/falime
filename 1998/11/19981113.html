<P CLASS=first>Not much happening at work.  Fixed a few errors, added some value, played lots of Solitaire.  Oh, and 'Concentration', a picture-matching game that a colleague has written in Visual Basic.  That kind of thing is going on quite a bit at the moment; writing fun software for want of something to do.  People are picking up some useful skills that way, perhaps I should give it a try.</P>

<P>A couple of guys are having a screen-saver writing competition.  It's all very secretive, but just occasionally I get brief insights when my mathematical knowledge (what remains of it) is called upon for help.  I receive strange emails asking me about light diffraction, vectors, cross products, and the structure of <A HREF="http://www.carbon60.co.uk" target="_blank" title="learn more about C60">the Carbon 60 molecule</A>.  Even less often, I'm actually able to be of assistance, such as today when I was asked the formula for roots of a quadratic equation.  Mmmm.  It actually felt great to still know that; I think it was my most significant 'achievement' of the week.</P>

<BR><HR><BR><P CLASS=first STYLE="font-size: 8pt">I often spend days on end away from my PC.  It's hell.  It has the side-effect that I don't get to update this journal as often as I like.  So, rather than have you making fruitless repeat visits to these pages, I've set up a notify list.  Just click the lovely pink button over on the left.  Alternatively, for the hyper-paranoid, simply <A STYLE="font-size: 8pt" HREF="mailto:journal@horatio.force9.net">email me</A> and I'll do the rest.</P>
