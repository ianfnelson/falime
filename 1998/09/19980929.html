<P>Day Two - Carn A'Mhaim (3,402ft / 1,037m), Ben Macdui (4,295ft / 1,309m).</P>
<P>I'm really not fit enough for this lark.  As Rich later said, "Nel has invented a pace between stop and walk."  But at least I give it a go and get away from the PC once in a while.  Can't get much further away from it than Ben Macdui - just a shame we didn't reach the summit until almost dusk.  Oopsy.  By the time we got to the bothy it was pitch darkness, and the bothy was full of people who showed no intentions of squeezing up.  So after some chicken soup and bread (supplementing the two Mars Bars we had already eaten that day - bloaters or what?) we got into sleeping bags and survival bags for a rather damp night's sleep.  The first time I've ever worn a woolley hat while sleeping, and hopefully the last.  Oh well, at least it didn't rain.</P>
