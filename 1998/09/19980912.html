<P>I took Monday off, on the pretext that simply taking a Tuesday off work would look decidedly dodgy.  Luckily, it coincided with the release of the new <A HREF="http://www.manics.co.uk/" TARGET="_blank">Manic Street Preachers</A> LP, so it wasn't an entirely wasted holiday!</P>
<P>The weekend, too, was nice and relaxing.  <A HREF="cast.html#richard">Richard</A> phoned, and told me of some girls who were sat near him on a train.  Apparently one girl was considering whether or not to go out with some guy, and decided that her decision would be based on his music taste.  More specifically, she intended to ask him which was his favourite Manics LP, and would base her verdict on this alone!  Sounds a perfectly good idea to me, I think potential partners should be made to fill in some sort of questionaire covering taste in books, music, etc.  Wasn't there something about that in <I>Hi Fidelity</I>?
