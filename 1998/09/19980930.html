<P>On which it rained a lot.  Lots of walking across boggy marshy stuff sprinkled with deer and sheep crap.  Another metaphor for life, then.</P>

But we couldn't think of anything general, just a whole heap of one-off news events, celebrities, sporting events, and pop scenes with no real socio-cultural change beneath them.  With under 460 days left of the 1990's, I can't see that situation changing, either.  Hey ho.  "The transitional nineties", then.</P>
