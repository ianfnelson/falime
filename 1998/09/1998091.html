<P>Nothing much seemed to happen today, at work anyway.  It was one of those days.  So I went for an extended coffee break with some colleagues.  When I returned, I found a project manager, a senior developer, a team leader and one of my peers all waiting for me expectantly.  I'd only been gone for a few minutes, what the hell did they want that was so important?  Answer - one of them had a twenty-question lyric quiz, on which they needed my assistance!  I rattled off about half of the answers, which seemed to please.  There you go, I achieved something today.  Not sure if I can mention it in my appraisal tomorrow, though.</P>

<P>As of today I've been in the world of work for exactly one year.  My spirit has been crushed and broken by this Dilbertian environment already, and I'm only 22.  *sigh*  Today I've just gazed out of the window a lot and reflected on what a dull year it's been, and how little I seem to have accomplished.  The weather outside is changeable - rainy, then misty, then bright sunshine, then heavy rain again in the early evening.  The meteorological climate seems to be mirroring the economic one, or vice versa.</P>
<BR>
<P>Now it's the evening once more, and a bottle of Chilean Merlot and John Peel on the radio are my only salvation once more.  Ah, and the great man is playing the title track of the new Belle & Sebastian LP.  Life's not so bad, really.</P>
