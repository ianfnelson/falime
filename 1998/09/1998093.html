<P>Back down to Birmingham again.  I just estimated that in the last year, I spent 17 whole days driving on motorways and trunk roads.  Which makes it all the more worrying when you see accidents, and I saw the aftermath of two during this journey.  The first was on the opposite side of the motorway - as I drove past I could see a pale looking guy in a van being strapped into a neckbrace.  The second was on the A42 - a totally burnt-out car, requiring three fire engines, an ambulance, and three cop cars.  I wonder how long my luck is going to hold out?</P>
<P>I got to the hotel safely, though.  It was full of beautiful people dressed in Dolce & Gabanna, those who <I>thought</I> they were beautiful, and yuppie business types carrying laptops into the restaurant.  Oh, and me, in my dusty Wranglers and unironed shirt.  I couldn't be bothered going into the city for a curry, so ate in the hotel, where I devoured the biggest fish I have ever seen.</P>
<P>Emma had written, so I made use of the free time in the evening and wrote back.  She spent most of her letter bitching about work, which was quite cool as that was exactly what I felt like doing.  S'funny, I know very few people who actually <I>enjoy</I> what they do.  If disillusionment has set in after one year, how are we going to make it through the next 40?</P>
