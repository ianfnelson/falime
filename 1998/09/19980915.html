<P>I know I moan a lot about our motorways, but I do like the fact that I can just hop in a car and get anywhere in GB reasonably quickly.  It never fails to strike me how much smaller our island feels than when I was a kid.  So it is that today I made a quick 450-mile round trip to Portsmouth for the purposes of a 45-minute interview, which was undoubtedly a very poor indicator of my ability to do a job.  Curiously, I still don't know exactly what that job would entail, which made it all the more bizarre an experience.</P>
<P>Only the civil service would require that I took along my academic certificates and passport!  The degree certificate had to be removed from its £4.99 Supasnaps frame, the GCSE ones located from deep within the bowels of my mother's house.  Oh, and of course I had to sign a form stating that I had never been involved in terrorism, espionage, or tried to overthrow parliament.  Apparently voting <A HREF="http://www.labour.org.uk/" TARGET="_blank">Labour</A> at the last election doesn't fall under that latter category, so I scrawled my name accordingly.</P>
<P>It was the sort of interview I would have relished a couple of years ago, as it concentrated heavily on my degree and current affairs, both of which I seem to have become quite rusty on since leaving uni.  My answers to techy questions were less than ideal, I had to turn them on their head to enable me to sound vaguely intelligent.  Oh, and Game Theory came up, of course, as did that bloody undergraduate project I did on the National Lottery back in winter 96.  To say that I was less than hot on the topics covered would be an understatement.  By contrast, my last year's work was discussed in just a few brief minutes.  But Nelson, isn't that how you <I>wanted</I> it to be?</P>
<P>Oh, and as expected, they warned me that the <I>remuneration</I> would not be at the levels I have become accustomed to.</P>
<BR>
<P>I don't know what I'd do if I was offered a position (unlikely to happen, anyway).  Stay doing a job I detest, or do something interesting which wouldn't pay my debts?</P>
<BR>
<P>I stopped at Cherwell Valley services to get some food.  No burger store, so I was forced to buying a pack of hideous sandwiches.  I thought I'd be safe with 'Egg mayonnaise and Lincolnshire Sausage', but it turned out to contain tomato, so I had to throw them away.  What a waste of £1.99.  I wish manufacturers would accommodate those of us who detest vegetables by highlighting the contents more clearly - tomato was right down at the bottom of the small print, next to the Monosodium Glutamate.  We need little symbols, akin to the ones to show that something <I>is</I> vegetarian.  So I ate nothing all day but a Snickers, a Twirl, and a bowl of Alpen.  Not good.</P>
