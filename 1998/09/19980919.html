<P>Now that email has long been my standard way of communicating, snail mail feels like it should have some extra gravitas.  If people take the time to create a physical object and spend money delivering it to me, it should be relatively important.  Or so the (evidently flawed) theory goes.  So what's in my (snail) mailbox this week?</P>
<P>First up, a letter from personnel telling me what preparation to do for <I>the course I attended a fortnight ago</I>.  Well, that was useful, wasn't it?  What a fucking joke.  As I said, personnel are incredibly inefficient.</P>
<P>Next we have a company who want to mail me CDs, tapes, and magazines letting me know all about new software developments.  Hmm, how dull.  As if I don't pick up on these things via the net, without splashing out on what the blurb calls <I>"audio briefing tapes so that you hear the latest developments while travelling to work."</I>  I can't think of anything more depressing!</P>
<P>Then there's the obligatory company claiming to get me lower motor insurance: <I>"Why pay more, Mr Nelson?" "Just think what you could do with the extra cash Mr Nelson.  CDs?  New clothes?  A weekend break?"</I>  Marketing has just gone silly.</P>
<P>Hewlett-Packard suggesting I buy the biggest laser printer I've ever seen - why?!  My nice laserjet is more than adequate for my needs.  Leave me alone!  At least with email I can easily filter out all the crap...</P>
