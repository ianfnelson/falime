<P><I>"You must enter a valid five-digit ZIP code to register with this website."</I></P>
<P>Uh, even if I don't live in the US?  Yep, apparently so.  Hmm, a use at last for that Aaron Spelling show.  I do wish website designers would take some time to consider those of us in Europe once in a while.</P>
<BR><P>It's never easy to relax on a Sunday knowing that the working week starts again at 5:30 the next morning, but I've tried my best.  Am reading the new Julian Barnes novel, <I>"England, England"</I>, which is all very wonderful, and, well, English.  It even prompted me to dig out my old jigsaw puzzle of the British Isles.</P>
<BR><P>Also spent quality time listening to some good music:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Manic Street Preachers - "This is My Truth, Tell Me Yours"</LI>
<LI>Spinanes - "Arches and Aisles"</LI>
<LI>Billy Bragg & Wilco - "Mermaid Avenue"</LI>
<LI>Beatles - "Revolver"</LI>
<LI>Barenaked Ladies - "Stunt"</LI>

<P>Quite a pleasant weekend, really.  Hey, and only one five days separate me from a week-long holiday.  Whether it's will be Scotland or Wales remains to be seen, but either way I'm looking forward to getting away from it all for a while.  There's just the small matter of the intervening five days at work.  My weekdays are less than ideal; I've been browsing Sartre and <A HREF="http://www.coupland.com" TARGET="_blank">Coupland</A> for sympathy.</P>
<P>And now, to distract myself from the weekend coming to a shattering halt, I'm off to tidy up my CD collection (the most orderly part of my room), and organise my IE4 Favorites.  These are things that, perversely, I enjoy doing...</P>
