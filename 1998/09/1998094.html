<P>Well would you believe it?  The course turned out to be a <I>Personal and Career Development Workshop</I> - that couldn't have come along at a more appropriate time.  S'funny, I went into the room feeling disillusioned and hoping I could win the lottery to escape the rat race, and now I actually feel positive about my career, and how to progress.  I won't go into the details, because it'll bore you, but this was probably the best days course I've ever been on.  I'm now viewing myself and my work in a totally different light.  Wow.</P>
<P>Oh, and it's a four-day course.  Personnel neglected to tell me that, the plebs.  Unfortunately I can't make the next three, so I'll have to rearrange to go on them some other time.  I mean, you would expect to be given more than a few hours notice of the dates, wouldn't you?</P>
<P>We did Myers-Briggs personality type testing today, it was really cool.  I came to the conclusion that I'm an INTP, for the record.  The top career suggested for that personality was "Computer Professional" - well whaddya know?!</P>
