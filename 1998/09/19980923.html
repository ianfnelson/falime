<P>Wednesdays have a tendency to suck.  Throughout my so-called formative years they were always my favourite day of the week, but now they're just boring, neither-here-nor-there type days.  Hey ho.  And I could go on about how dull work was, but I won't.  Not this time.</P>
<BR><P>Another day, then.  Stayed away from home again, and the undisputed highlight of my day was the BBC2 documentary on the Manic Street Preachers.  I need a holiday.  Roll on Scotland.</P>
