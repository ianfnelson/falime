<P CLASS="first">Obligatory Friday morning hangover. Oh, dress-down day. Shit,
what <I>casual</I> clothes do I have? Just the stuff I wore last night and a
pile of old T-shirts and jeans. I consider wearing a suit and ignoring the DDD,
but don't want to miss out on this once-in-a-month opportunity. OK, those light
blue jeans look (fairly) clean. And I can survive in a climate-controlled
office without the luxury of a shirt/jumper. But which T-shirt? I wore the only
decent one last night; it now stinks of fags and is stained with beer. In the
end I plump for the 'mod' target, hoping to avoid any amusing comments. Ha, I
should be so lucky. I thought I'd heard every joke during the four years that
I'd owned that mod t-shirt. But I was wrong. </P>
<BR>
<P CLASS="first">After a week of trying, I managed to break through a mighty
barrier of red tape in order to do a task which had been requested of me. It
involved many emails, and taking things to absurdly high management levels, but
at least the job can now go ahead. I don't enjoy this sort of thing, my
<I>people skills</I> are not finely honed yet. I'm a developer, a programmer, a
computer nerd, a geek. I adore logic, not bureacracy and the ways of business. 
</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS="first">I complimented a colleague on his model of calculator today.
It was a Sharp EL-557, my all-time favourite. Fortunately he didn't accuse me
of being insane, or strange, because he too was proud to own an EL-557, and
respected it's power. Since I got my own EL-557 for Christmas at the beginning
of this strange decade, I've owned many other calculating devices, often
professing to have greater functionality. But to my mind the EL-557 is a
timeless classic, like a fine wine, classic car, or favourite record.</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS="first">Later, home again. It's been a long and fairly busy week,
something which these journal entries do not adequately convey. I forget too
much of the detail, and neglect to note down far too many of my thoughts and
musings. A handheld PC is, I think, becoming a 'necessity'. </P>
<P>This evening I did some surfing, and 'accidentally' spent over $100 at
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com" TARGET="_blank" TITLE="Amazon">Amazon</A>. Then
I played around with my workstation configuration for a while. I tried to
install NT4 Service Pack 4, but it didn't work, and the HP printer went a
little crazy (spewing out blank sheets continually). Uh-oh, I can see another
re-installation of the OS approaching...</P><BR>&nbsp;<BR>
