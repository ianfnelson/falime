<P CLASS=date>Saturday, 5th December 1998</P><BR>
<P CLASS=fact align=right>Birthday of Imam Mahdi, Iran</P><BR>

<P CLASS=first>On which it rained, snowed, and was cold, providing me with little impetus to leave the house.  So I rediscovered my interest in <A HREF="http://www.mersenne.org/" target="_top">Mersenne Primes</A>, and coded some webpages (hey, you're looking at one right now...).  Actually, it's not been such an antisocial day - my youngest sister and her family have visited, and <A HREF="../../cast/cast.html#emma" target="main">Emma</A> telephoned, which was nice.  But mostly I've just mucked around in cyberspace.</P>
<P>Oh, and drank coffee!  I tried that new liquid coffee extract stuff - very nice, most impressed.  The hi-tech dispensing mechanism built into the bottle is obviously a selling point for people such as myself - much more fun than sticking a teaspoon into a jar.</P>
