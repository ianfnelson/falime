<P CLASS=date>Thursday, 3rd December 1998</P><BR>
<P class=fact align=right>National Day, United Arab Emirates<BR>The Night of Forgiveness (Muslim)</P><BR>
<P class=y2k align=right>Y2K-394</P><BR>
<P CLASS=first>A most enjoyable evening out with colleagues (and no, I'm not just saying that).  Plenty of good beer early on, followed by some appalling lagers later on in a club.  Alcohol prices in clubs continue to perplex me - faced with a large sign saying &quot;Bottles £1&quot;, I asked for a bottle of Heineken, which turned out to be £2.60.  But the pints of Heineken (containing much more than a bottle), <I>were</I> just £1.  I don't understand this when sober, I have little chance in the early hours of the morning after having consumed plenty of conventionally-priced booze.</P>
<P>Despite these strange discrepancies, the club was fun, the music vaguely enjoyable - any place that follows <I>A Town Called Malice</I> by <I>The Eton Rifles</I> before launching into some cheesy new romanticism is OK by me, at least when I'm too drunk to care more.</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>The topic of anonymity came up again today - a colleague couldn't believe that I diverted an anonymous phone call to ansaphone (I have caller ID), and when the caller left no message, I was asked if I wasn't just a tiny bit curious as to who had been phoning.  Well, I'm not.  It was probably a wrong number - anyone who knows me would've left a message.  Besides, I was busy with a call on a landline, so it's not as if I was being <I>totally</I> ignorant.</P>
