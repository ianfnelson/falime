<P CLASS=first>Well, that was moderately successful.  I haven't finished my Christmas shopping, but I've got a sizeable chunk of it completed.  Surprisingly, the shopping mall wasn't too busy, I found it easy to walk around and get what I needed.  All the queues were tiny, too.  Economically speaking, this is a bad thing.</P>
