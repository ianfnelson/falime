<P CLASS="first">I wonder how much of my life I've spent installing and
re-installing software. Far too much, in all probability. But in a perverse
way, I kinda enjoy clearing out my hard drive and starting again afresh. My
cyber-world is kept far neater than my rl world, as anybody who's been
unfortunate enough to see my living environment will know. Still, it all seems
to be working fine now.</P>
<P>In between inserting CD-ROMs and clicking on &quot;OK&quot;, I've been
labelling Christmas presents. Gift tags seem too arty-farty, so I've been more
practical and simply used sticky address labels. Less attractive, perhaps, but
equally as functional. </P>
<BR>
<P CLASS="first">I'm writing this using a 30-day trial version of HoTMetaL Pro
5.0, which is certainly the best HTML editor I've ever test-driven. Indeed,
it's the only one that hasn't been uninstalled within the half-hour, and I just
<I>lurve</I> this tags-on mode. But a quick sojourn to the relevant homepage
revealed a price tag of &#163;99+VAT+Shipping, so I guess it'll be back to
Notepad from the New Year.</P>
