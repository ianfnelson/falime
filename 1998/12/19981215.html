<P CLASS="first">Sat at work thinking about databases. I recently tried to
create an Access database of my music collection, which was a more difficult
task than I first envisaged. Nothing to do with the complexity of the software,
or the usual programming hassles, it was a matter of failing to devise an
adequate data model. So I emailed a few colleagues describing my problems,
which generated a fair bit of email traffic in return. It would appear that
relational database design is a far more interesting subject than our various
work-related tasks.</P>
<P>Anyway, I think I now have a decent data model, so perhaps I'll give the
database another shot this weekend. I realise that it's a bit of a sad thing to
do, but I'm using at as a means of learning Access and database query skills
rather than out of any real desire to have an accurate database showing the
world how many Menswe@r singles I own!</P>
