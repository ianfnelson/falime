<P CLASS=date>Monday, 7th December 1998</P><BR>
<P CLASS=fact align=right>Earthquake Memorial Day, Armenia</P><BR>

<P CLASS=first><I>&quot;...icy patches on those roads, so do take care and allow extra time for your journey...&quot;</I></P><BR>
<P>Extra time, sure - but 2.75 hours to travel 85 miles is just ridiculous.  I was hampered by running out of windscreen water, and found a queue of five cars waiting to use the dispenser at the nearest services - and this at 06:45!  Not a pleasant start to the day.  England in December is bleak enough at that time of the morning, but having to fight my way through the <I>rush hour</I> meant that I arrived in Birmingham for my half-day course in a foul mood.  Course over, and career goals reaffirmed, I drove into the city centre and parked <A HREF="../../cast/cast.html#morky" target="main">the Morkster</A> on the tenth storey of an NCP before lunching with <A HREF="../../cast/cast.html#richard" target="main">Richard</A>.  Then it was back up the motorways to Yorkshire once more.</P><BR>
<P CLASS=first>And so it is that you are blessed with a midweek journal update.  I hope you feel privileged.  Shame I have nothing worthwhile to mention, really.</P><BR>
<P CLASS=first>I have moved out of my usual room, and into the spare room.  Not exactly the grand move that I was considering recently in this journal (the one requiring a mortgage and liberal use of the IKEA catalogue), but a slight move nonetheless.  Actually, it was largely unavoidable, as my bed collapsed on Sunday afternoon.  Admittedly, I could have simply switched the beds around, but that sounds far too energy-consuming, and besides, I have an ulterior motive - I am slowly expanding the areas of the house that are directly under my control.  Soon I won't merely be sleeping in the spare room, I'll have moved some of my belongings in there, leaving much space in my 'real' room, especially if I dispose of the now broken bed.  I haven't exactly figured out why I need vast arrays of space, but the idea of my own LAN is beginning to appeal...!</P>
<P>The above paragraph is mostly untrue, or at least a gross exaggeration.  Please, no more email telling me I'm a sad bastard, I have quite enough to be getting on with.</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>Tomorrow is the allotted day when my VISA card and I brave the shopping malls in a near-impossible attempt to buy all my Christmas gifts in a single day.  I don't mind giving presents, but the task of selecting them fills me with dread.  I have little idea what others would like to receive, or how to evaluate the worthiness of various products on offer.  I wish I could buy everybody an Intel processor or a CD-ROM for Christmas, it would make things much easier.  Oh well, wish me luck...</P>
