<P CLASS=first>'Free Bar' has to be one of my favourite phrases in the world, and I was determined not to let the opportunity (project Christmas 'do') go to waste.  Champagne, champagne, beer, whisky, bottle of wine, whisky, beer... mmmmmm...</P>
<P>Apart from the alcohol, it was a relatively uneventful evening - everybody seemed to fall asleep before they had a chance to cause any real mayhem.  I just sat talking crap all evening - unfortunately I did so to someone who was perfectly sober and therefore could spend the next day filling me in on what I had said.  Bastard.</P>
<P>The journey home was cool.  Four of us crammed into the back seat of a Mondeo, singing "Gold" by Spandau Ballet (for reasons which are unlikely to become clear in the near future).  Equally mysteriously, I decided to open one of the rear doors whilst the vehicle was moving, which in retrospect strikes me as being a bit silly.  I think I'll lay off the grog for a while..</P>
