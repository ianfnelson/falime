<P CLASS=first>I've received some good feedback regarding these pages in recent days, all of which has been very constructive, so thank you.  I've hopefully solved one of the major complaints using cookie technology - the front page should now tell you whether there are any new journal entries since last you visited.  Cool, huh?  That was a day well spent.</P><BR>
