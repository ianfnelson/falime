<P CLASS="fact" ALIGN="right">Another day devoid of any meaning</P>

<P CLASS="first">My future has now been revealed to me. As of 1999 I'm to move
to another IS department at the same client site. Suits me fine, I didn't
really mind what happened, but I'm looking forward to a slight change in role
and workload. I'll be glad to put all this Y2K work behind me.</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS="first">Against my better judgement, I went out pubbing n clubbing
with colleagues until late. It was, um, OK. We tried a new club which turned
out to be fairly dire, so drank up quickly and departed. The evening ended in
the same fashion as ever; 'dancing' to an overly populist selection of pop hits
from the last thirty-five years. I see little point in paying to hear songs
that have been ingrained into my mind over the course of my life, in the same
way that I hate commercial radio stations that play endless Top 10 hit singles.
But on a Thursday night after work, that's just the way it is. Everyone has to
go to the same place, so the music has to be accessible to all. </P>
