<P CLASS="first">Up at 5:30am and off for a final full week of work before the
holidays. Hardly any colleagues around, they all seemed to be on courses,
holiday, or sick. So I actually got some work done. Watched some bad TV, went
to bed. </P>
<P>I'd like to say more, but there's nothing to say.</P>
