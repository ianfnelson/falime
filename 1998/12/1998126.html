<P CLASS=date>Sunday, 6th December 1998</P><BR>
<P CLASS=fact align=right>2nd Sunday in Advent<BR>Constitution Day, Spain<BR>Independence Day, Finland</P><BR>
<P CLASS=y2k align=right>Y2K-391</P><BR>
<P CLASS=first><A HREF="http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm" target="_blank" title="Join the Borg...">This</A> is easy!  The weekend is still young, and already I rank 5,619 in the list of prime number finding CPU-power providers.  Gee, I feel so benevolent...</P><BR>
<P CLASS=first>Today I saw yet more nieces, nephews, and their relevant parents.  This is becoming habitual, but I wouldn't give them up for all the CPU cycles in the world, they're fab kids.  Useful, too - my eldest nephew knows the contents of my food cupboards better than I do, so I've just discovered goodies I never knew I had.  Yum.</P>
<P>Ever mindful of the younger generation's developmental needs, I decided it would be a sensible idea to repay this favour by introducing my nephew to the wonders of the internet.  <A HREF="http://www.jailbabes.com/" target="_blank">Jailbabes</A> and <A HREF="http://www.skintwo.co.uk/" target="_blank">Skin Two</A> didn't seem suitable, so instead we surfed on over to the excellent <A HREF="http://www.beano.co.uk/" target="_blank">Beano website</A>.  To be honest, I think I enjoyed our visit more than he did - as a kid who's used to the speeds of UDMA hard disks and 24x speed CD-ROM drives, he found the download times quite frustrating (he's not a very patient chappy).  This made me prematurely nostalgic once more - when I was just a couple of years older than he is, I would happily wait for half an hour whilst a game loaded from audio cassette onto an 8-bit home computer with a 16Kb RAM.  How far we've progressed...</P><BR>
<P CLASS=first>In other news... I see from my webpage log thingy that somebody stumbled across my site by searching <A HREF="http://www.metacrawler.com" target="_blank">Metacrawler</A> for the keywords &quot;personal porn page&quot;.  I have a feeling they may have been quite disappointed...</P>
