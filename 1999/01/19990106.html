<P CLASS=first>Happier.  I have a program to write, a <I>proper</I> program with a purpose, which will be run daily, and which will have my name at the top.  And although it's going to be fairly tricky for someone of my meagre experience, it's just hard enough to be a challenge I'll relish whilst not being dauntingly impossible.  So, I feel fairly good about myself again.</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>More phone calls.  When I agreed to organise our next trip to the Highlands, I forgot that most of my accountant friends have their schedules booked months in advance, leaving me to deal with ridiculous statements such as "I'm free week commencing July 26th, if that helps..."  I think a mass email or five are called for.  My mother seems to have gotten the right idea - "I'm going on holiday somewhere sunny - will you drive me to Manchester airport?"  Good for her.</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>I've just spent a good five minutes trying to define "cheesy" to some colleagues who profess not to know what I meant by it.  Surely they're just trying to wind me up - everyone knows what constitutes a cheesy film, don't they?</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>Hump day over then, and tomorrow's Thursday.  But I think I'll give the traditional Thursday night out on the town a miss this week - ain't I good?</P>
