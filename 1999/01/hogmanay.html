<P CLASS=first>This is the third time I've sat and tried to write about our festive break in Fort Bill.  Each previous attempt has degenerated into a long-winded essay of the "What I did on my holidays" variety.  So, I'll try to summarise it briefly.</P><BR>

<P CLASS=first>Post-Christmas, myself and many friends headed north to Fort William for a week of drinking and munro-bagging.  I'm more than a little ashamed to admit that I didn't do anything more strenuous than take a stroll down Glen Nevis, but that didn't stop me having a great time.</P><BR>

<P CLASS=first>Five of us had clubbed together to rent a house for the week, and various others joined us for a few days at a time, throwing money in towards the rent and food.  I think this free-n-easy coming and going scenario helped keep the week interesting - a variety of people to chat and drink with, but never too overcrowded.</P><BR>

<P CLASS=first>It's not often that I've felt so relaxed or at ease with myself as during this week.  Usually being in such a remote location, sans internet etc would merely lead to boredom.  But I was far from being bored.  The nights were fun, and more than a little alcoholic.  Indeed, everybody returned to England vowing to lay off the grog for a couple of weeks (though how many of us actually did so was never ascertained).</P><BR>

<P CLASS=first>The chronology of the week has now blurred itself in my memory, so that I'm left with just a group of unconnected anecdotes, or funny moments:</P><BR>
<UL>
<LI><P CLASS=first>George trying to woo the highland women by shouting "BLAAAARGGH!" in their faces at high volume.  </P></LI><BR>

<LI><P CLASS=first>A race in supermarket trolleys, fuelled by copious quantities of bacardia (I mean us, not the trolleys).  </P></LI><BR>

<LI><P CLASS=first>Taking the Corran ferry on the way to Strontian and getting confused about which island we were on - I was quite embarrassed to learn we had never left the UK mainland.</P></LI><BR>

<LI><P CLASS=first>The mad hogmanay ceilidh, where a dappy girl "fainted", dozens of youths started a fight, and Andy tried to kill Paul over a matter of 30 quid.  And later that night, Lex and Kim getting it together, only to be disturbed by a drunken George clambering into bed with them at 6am.</P></LI><BR>

<LI><P CLASS=first>"They're coming out!"</P></LI><BR>

<LI><P CLASS=first>The endless bacon, irn bru, and beer (natch).  The drive to the Glenfiddan monument, where we sheltered from the torrential rain for 10 minutes before heading back again.  </P></LI><BR></UL>

<P CLASS=first>It was all just plain good fun, really.  Very relaxing.  I could say more, but I'd bore you.</P><BR>

<P CLASS=first>Those who were left at home weren't relaxed, though.  As we drove back down south on Saturday 2nd January, my mobile phone beeped crazily to alert me to a backlog of messages, all of which were from worried family members.  There had been a fatal avalanche in Fort Bill during our stay, which had panicked those who knew I'd been up there.  At least, those who didn't realise that I was more likely to be slumped in an armchair watching a Bond movie than on the highest summits in the country.</P><BR>

<P CLASS=first>Then, Sunday 3rd January.  Finally heading back to South Yorkshire on a train from Lexy's pad in Manchester.  Incredibly depressing, having to get back to your 'real life' after such a fun vacation.  But no matter, we'll be back up there again soon, I've no doubt.</P><BR>
