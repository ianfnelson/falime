<P CLASS=first>Tic-tacs in the snack vending machine - woohoo, how cool is that?  Zo, now I can 'av two 'ours of tic-tac frezhness in jus' two calories - great, ha?</P>
<P>Nurofen, too.  And Fisherman's friend - must be the time of year for it.  Wonder what'll sit alongside the chocolate bars tomorrow morning... suggestions on a postcard.</P><BR>

<P CLASS=first>A bit of a mad day for the ol' email, too.  No actual <I>work</I>, per se, but lots of strange messages to keep me busy.  One asked if I wanted my departmental details changed on the email address book - <I>"Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help.." </I>- evidently someone else with nothing much to do.  Then a potential training plan for new recruits, sent to me by the author for my thoughts and ideas - I had none, so forwarded it on.  </P>
<P>Yup, it's been a weird old day.  For once, the legitimate corporate happenings kept me more amused than the dodgy email jokes that usually make life bearable.  We received corporate 1999 wall calendars today, so that was something to look at for a while.  Also I had a fairly decent review with our project manager, where I asked for a change of job title.  I can't believe something so inconsequential should bother me at all, and as I brought the matter up there was a little voice in the back of my head shouting "You sad bastard!  You're turning into Dilbert, you know!"  But perhaps I <I>should</I> be thinking about my career more seriously than I have done up to now.</P><BR>
<P CLASS=first>Phone call from Harriet as I ate in a great curry house - finalising details for meeting on Saturday, so I had to surreptitiously whip out my Psion to key in an address.  Not just Dilbert, then - I'm also turning into the yuppies I despised just a few short years ago.</P>
