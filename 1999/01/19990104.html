<P CLASS=first>"When you're this high, you can only come down."<BR>So read anti-drugs messages on advertising hoardings back when I was in my early teens.  Narcotically-speaking, I'm clean as a whistle, but emotionally-speaking, this 1980's government warning describes my mood perfectly.</P>
<P>Even when my festive period has not been spent in such a sociable and enjoyably drunken manner as this year, I still abhor January.  Cold, wet, dark, <I>English</I> January, with nothing to look forward to and all daylight hours filled with mind-numbing, spirit-crushing 'work'.</P>
<P>Work.  That came as a fucking culture shock, my 5:30am reminder call striking fear into my heart (how this was omitted from the Q chart of "15 most terrifying sounds on earth", I'll never know).  More weeks ahead of doing... whatever it is I do.  Oh well.  It pays the bills, and by Easter I'll have some cash with which to return to Scotland and do it all over again...</P>
<P>But meanwhile I'm stuck in this English January, a prisoner of both time and economics, trying to remember how to make it all pass by less painfully.  I've got the comfort food (chocolate, crisps, muesli - but no alcohol, my liver wants a week or two to recover), and the imported CDs and books.  Now I just need to feed my technolust with some new gadgets.</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>I think I'd better start making plans for my weekends - do some travelling, see friends in London and Derby, Bradford and Manchester, Hampshire and Edinburgh...</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>It's only <I>January</I> Nelson.  It's nothing to be afraid of.  Remember, everyone else feels this way too.</P>

<IMG SRC="blonde2.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=226 ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP BORDER=2><P CLASS=first>I wish I had more time to read other online journals, there are plenty of great ones out there.  Take <A HREF="http://members.tripod.com/~onetongrrl/journal.html" TARGET="_blank" TITLE="Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup.">Cyberpunk Musings</A>, which has been making me laugh recently.  Melissa recently dyed her hair red (good on ya!) - wish I still had that option open to me.  I only once really altered my dark brown hair, by bleaching it to yellow.  I wussed out of colouring it, and dyed it back to brown a few days later.  Now, with my career prospects to think about, it's too late to play about with hair dye, more's the pity.</P>
