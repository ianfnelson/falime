<P CLASS=first>Today has actually flown by quite pleasantly.  The music stopped, and so I changed desks once again, facilitating an enjoyable hour or so setting up preferences on my new PC, creating a new nameplate for my cubicle wall, etc.  Ah, it's the little things that make me happiest (hey, that brings me back to this sexy new Psion with which I'm writing this...)</P>
<P>After those fun tasks, I actually got down to some real coding, the novelty of which has not yet worn off.  Oh, and a recruitment agency telephoned me to ask for an updated CV - apparently they have a number of positions in the Yorkshire area which might suit me.  I'm not actively looking for a new job at the moment, but I guess it doesn't hurt to take an interest in what else is out there, while I'm in the fortunate position of being a marketable commodity.</P>

<BR><P CLASS=first>Chris Moyles is a funny bloke.  I've known this for a while, of course, but this evening it was kinda confirmed when I sat in my car listening to him for five minutes before entering the house.  He certainly is the saviour of Radio 1, much better than Zoe Ball, anyway.</P>

<BR><P CLASS=first>Random thing that bugs me: when Scots (who, by and large, I adore) use "but" in place of "though".  OK, so my grammar is not the bestest (sic) in the world, but this transposition is just plain silly.  There we go, minor gripe of  the day over.</P>
<BR><P CLASS=first>At lunch today somebody launched a vitriolic attack on those who go mountain-walking, declaring it to be a pointless exercise.  I could have argued against this opinion, but really there seemed little point.  When a person has made his or her mind up so surely, it's a waste of my time and energy trying to change their point of view.  Besides, I don't really care too much what other's think.  I enjoy munro-bagging (honest, guys!), it's sociable, it's good exercise, it offers a vast array of views and experiences.  There's much more to those mountains than just big lumps of rock.   All human life is up there, really - you learn a lot about yourself up there, and have a lot of time to think about the world in which you live.  It's a cleansing, liberating experience.  The phrase <I>get away from it all</I> has been much maligned in recent years, but on a good day it's quite apt to use it in reference to the munros.  With our hectic modern lifestyles, getting away from it all occasionally can only be a good thing.</P>

<BR><P CLASS=first>Made my weekly shopping trip today, and returned with yet more 'comfort food' and very little which could be said to constitute a <I>meal</I>.  Creme Eggs, Aero Eggs...  and a 'cocktail-in-a-bag' - a strawberry daiquiri which has been sat in the freezer for the past few hours and should be about ready for drinking now.  Yum, can't wait...</P>
<BR><P CLASS=first> <B><I>22:03</P>
</B></I><P CLASS=first>I was just heading to bed when the TV announcer introduced <I>Kes</I>, Jarvis Cocker's favourite movies and possibly one of the greatest ever made - in South Yorkshire, at least.  The telly rarely gets as good as this - and the housies have already retired, so I can relax and savour it (along with the aforementioned strawberry daiquiri!).  It's been a long day, but <I>Kes </I>is worth staying up for.  As Neil from <I>The Young Ones</I> said: "sleep gives you cancer, man, everyone knows that."</P>

<B><I><BR><P CLASS=first>22:38</P>
</B></I><P CLASS=first>I know it sounds like something very obvious, but it never fails to amaze me how very <I>different</I> the world looked only a short time ago.  Of course, at the moment this thought has struck me due to watching <I>Kes</I>, but the same is true of 'old' photographs, even from just a few years ago.  The velocity of change seems to be increasing.</P>
<P>OK pop tarts - ten points for the title of the French tribute LP featuring a screen-shot from <I>Kes</I> on the cover?</P>
<B><I><BR><P CLASS=first>22:47</P>
</B></I><P CLASS=first>Y'know, the scenes in <I>Kes</I> of a South Yorkshire PE lesson would be funny if they weren't so damned accurate, regardless of decade.</P>
