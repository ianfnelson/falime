<P CLASS=location>West Yorkshire</P>
<P CLASS=time>23:01</P>
<P CLASS=first>I know I vowed not to talk about the weather so much this year, but it remains one of the main talking points, which possibly just goes to show how mundane other aspects of life are.  Today in West Yorkshire it was refreshingly sunny, and a little warmer, which seemed to cheer everybody up and cause many to leave the climate-controlled office earlier than usual.  I, however, diligently hung around until 16:45, but as I had been utterly devoid of work all day, this wasn't especially tough.  For a split second this afternoon I began to wonder how the company could afford to employ me, but that was until I totted up the amount I spent today on doughnuts and coffee - evidently the cafeteria is doing a roaring trade out of the employees and boosting revenues...</P>

<P CLASS=first>Petty Dilbertesque snipes aside, things remain positively upbeat as I head closer to my next Scottish jaunt (the first of '99, unless you count New Year, which I don't).  The plan of attack remains pretty vague - Brucey is so close to compleating that it's only fair to leave the choice of munros to him, so it all depends which he still has to bag on the day in question.</P>

<P CLASS=first>In an interesting development on the pop trivia questions I'm used to receiving on my mobile (usually from people at work / in the pub who suddenly need to know who sang <I>"The Heat Is On"</I>), my mother called me this evening wishing to know a word of the form ??sc?ss which wasn't "abscess".  What next?</P>
<P>I once made the bold assertion to Rich and Brucey that a generic "information line" set up to answer these sort of queries would be a viable business proposition, but as we walked on and discussed the matter more, I had to admit that it was totally unworkable.  Shame though - there are dozens of times when I've been out on the town and had the sudden uncontrollable urge to know what the theme to <I>Tales of the Unexpected</I> sounded like, or remember the name of Beth's boyfriend in <I>Neighbours</I> or whatever...</P>
<P>Speaking of trivia, <I>University Challenge</I> was too hard this evening, I only got one or two questions correct, which is quite pitiful.  I think I'll have to hand back my degree certificate and resort to watching <I>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire</I>...</P>
