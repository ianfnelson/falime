<P CLASS=location>South Yorkshire</P>
<P CLASS=first>Taking a day off to relax and recuperate from Saturday's Buachaille Etive Mor sesh', and I get a phone call:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>- "Hello, is that Mr Nelson?"</P>
<P>- "yep."</P>
<P>- "Ah, hello there.  I hope I've got the right person, I'm trying to contact a Mr Nelson who filled in a questionaire recently which had an award attached."</P>
<BR>
<P CLASS=first>Woohoo!  Finally, all my filling in of those bloody consumer survey questionnaires must've paid off!  I began to get giddy, but then she continued:</P>
<BR>
<P>- "So, can I just check a few details - you're married, aged over 65, are a houseowner, and have an income in excess of £18,000?"</P>
<P>- "Ah, um, not quite..  I'm not married, I'm aged under 65, and I don't own a house."</P>
<P>- "Oh dear, I'm sorry to have troubled you, I must've got the wrong person."</P>
<P>- "I earn about £18k, though - maybe it *is* me?  Can I have the prize award anyway?"</P>
<P>- "Um, no."</P>
