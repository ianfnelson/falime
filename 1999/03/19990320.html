<P CLASS=first>The mother returned from town proudly carrying a Black &amp; Decker hedge trimmer.  This had "bad idea" written all over it.  In a bit of a <I>Due South</I> moment, I swear I heard my late father ask "why the bloody hell have you let her have one of those?".</P>
<P>Sixty minutes later, my (our?) fears were realised.  Fortunately I <I>didn't</I> find myself making a dash to casualty; instead I was taking apart the strimmer to re-fit the cable, which was suddenly 50cm shorter than before.  </P>
<P>"I didn't even realise I'd cut it until the thing stopped working!"</P>
<P>Praise the lord for the wonder of 3 amp fuses.</P>
