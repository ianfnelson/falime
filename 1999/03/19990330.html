<P CLASS=location>South Yorkshire / West Yorkshire</P>
<P CLASS=first>Woke up at 05:30 after dreaming that Paul Merton had died.  If anybody can explain that one, I'd love to hear it (BTW - sorry Paul, nothing personal, honest!?).  An hour later, I was back on the road again, thankful that Rich had driven us to and from Edinburgh.</P>

<P CLASS=first>The week may be a short one, but if today is anything to go by, I have a feeling it's gonna feel just as long as any other.  Things are not going well, and the unintuitive nature of the work I do is wreaking havoc with my exhausted mind and body.  Perhaps Glencoe wasn't quite as relaxing as I'd intended?</P>
