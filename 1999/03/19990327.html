<P CLASS=location>Edinburgh / Glencoe / Tyndrum</P>
<P CLASS=first>Brucey's protective, cautionary side does not show itself often, but it's undoubtedly there.  One of his female housemates once commented that &quot;he really looks after us in the flat, he's like the Dad of the house!&quot; and I can now sort of imagine how this is true.  I get the feeling people are likely to misrepresent him as being some kind of mad Scottish loony, especially when up on the munros, risking his life for the sake of a quick bag or a bit of a laugh, but I'm beginning to think that under the "ker-azy" exterior, he's alarmingly sensible.  Posit: we're at the bottom of a gorgeous snow-covered gully on Buachaille Etive Mor, and I'm gagging to don some crampons (lent to me by the man himself), and get going.  But Brucey has other ideas:</P>
<P>&quot;Look, you're not f*cking going up there until you practice some ice-axe brakes!&quot;</P>
<P>In retrospect, this made good sense, but at the time I could have died of embarrasment.  I was going to be forced to do something I was crap at, in a situation I was uncomfortable in - and to make matters worse, some strangers were just about to wander past.  I remembered why I never learned to swim.</P>
<P>&quot;Just sit down, lift your feet up, slide down for a few metres, then turn round and dig your axe in.  You're not going up there until you've proved you can do it!&quot;</P>
<P>This wasn't the loony I'd come to know and love, who'd been thrown out of a club for trying to serve himself a pint of wine, who'd antagonised drunken youths outside the Ceilidh in Fort William, who'd fought with me two years previous over the matter of a now-hingeless kitchen door (and indeed, <I>with</I> the same kitchen door!)</P>
<P>&quot;But I'll get me arse wet!,&quot; I pleaded.  It didn't cut ice.  Only the ice-axe would do that.  Five attempts and a severely soggy bum later, Bruce conceded that I'd &quot;got the general idea.&quot;  In retrospect, I was thankful.  As with previous occasions in my life, it's always been my friends who've given me the advice I didn't want, but needed to hear, or forced me to do the things I didn't want to, but needed to do.</P>
<P CLASS=first>My arse dried mercifully quickly, and we the walk continued in superb fashion.  The weather held out, the skies were clear, and we could see for miles - brilliant views of Schiehallion, Ben Nevis, and out to Ben More.  The decision to drive up to Glencoe on the Saturday had certainly been the right one.  Amaretto, ham & cheese sandwiches, Snickers, Evian, and a choc dip turned a splendid day into a perfect one.  There was nowhere on earth I'd rather have been.  Photos will appear just as soon as they've been developed.</P>
<P CLASS=first>Descents always seem to conjure up mixed feelings in my mind and my heart.  Of course one part of me is looking forward to the prospect of warmth, and a change of socks, and a pint of Guinness, but leaving the mountain also seems to mark a return to "real life", and all the responsibilities and daily routines that that brings with it.  When you're far from civilisation, uncontactable, it's a very pleasant, liberating feeling.</P>
<P>The more familiar "lunatic" side of BJC returned to view as he bum-slid down a particularly huge corrie.  I remembered the awesome sight of the "death slide" at Lightwater Valley when I was nine years old, and decided to walk round instead.  Perhaps this was vaguely sensible - Brucey shredded his arse on a rock and Richy hit himself in the face with his ice axe during their speedy descent!</P><CENTER>
