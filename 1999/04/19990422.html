<P CLASS=first>Anakin rock (uh-huh).  The female vocalist wailed like a cross between Courtney Love, Manda Rin and Siousie Sioux whilst the band backed her up with a big sound resembling a meeting of Mogwai and the Smashing Pumpkins.  I was most definitely in my element, and began to wish, not for the first time, that venues akin to the <I>Seaforth Inn</I> existed within travelling distance of my home.  </P>
<P CLASS=first>Unlike my companions, I was distressingly sober, being both physically and mentally unable to quaff a respectable amount of alcohol that evening.  But even in my state of relative sobriety, I had to concur that, yes, the bassist was a babe.  But then, I've always been attracted to Scottish girls in bands (how else can I explain the Shirley Manson posters?!)</P>
