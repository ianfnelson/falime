<P CLASS=first>Giddy.  Looking forward to getting away from it all for a short time.  I feel like I did when I was seven years old, the evening before a promised excursion to a theme park.  Mobile phone and email conversations have been prevalent this week, as we've discussed all the intricacies of our vacation plans.  Which mountains to bag, which board games to take, and crucially, which brands of brown sauce to buy for our early morning bacon sandwiches.  For the first twenty-fours hours at least, this is going to be a highly-planned event.  After that, chaos theory will take hold just as soon as we first run out of bread....</P>

<P CLASS=first>Listening to: Portishead - <I>Dummy</I>.  The house is otherwise quiet, and even at a low volume, Beth's voice is filling the room with ease.  S'nice.  And it reminds me of happier times, back at uni, listening to this LP whilst simultaneously playing Risk and doing maths homework sheets...</P>
