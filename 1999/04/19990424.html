<P CLASS=location>Ullapool / Inverness / Edinburgh / South Yorkshire</P>

<P CLASS=first>Long 450 miles drive home.  We stopped off in Inverness for some lunch, and it really impressed me (the city, I mean, not the sandwich - although that was OK too).  It seemed to be a cute, modern little town, with all the mod-cons.  Just a shame it's so bloody far away...</P>
<P>Finally reached home at about 10pm, and began to wade through the junk mail, junk e-mail, and (somewhat bizarrely), junk ansafone messages.  Let the wonders of <A HREF="http://www.real.com" TARGET="_blank">RealAudio</A> show you what I mean...</P><BR>
<P><A HREF="call1.ram">Message 1</A> - <I>"We're having a great time..."</I></P>
<P><A HREF="call2.ram">Message 2</A> - <I>"Sorry about that..."</I></P>
<P><A HREF="call3.ram">Message 3</A> - <I>"Is Sylvia there?"</I></P>
<P><A HREF="call4.ram">Message 4</A> - <I>"Hi Syl, it's Peter..."</I></P>
<P CLASS=first>If, by any chance, you know who Peter (or Sylvia) are, please tell them to stop phoning me...!</P>
